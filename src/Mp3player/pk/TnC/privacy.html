<h2><a id="s1"></a>1. Introduction</h2>

<p>Thanks for choosing Beats!</p>

<p>At Beats, we want to give you the best possible experience to ensure that you enjoy our service today, tomorrow, and in the future. 
To do this we need to understand your listening habits so we can deliver an exceptional and personalized service specifically for you. 
That said, your privacy and the security of your personal data is, and will always be, enormously important to us. 
So, we want to transparently explain how and why we gather, store, share and use your personal data - 
as well as outline the controls and choices you have around when and how you share your personal data.</p>

<p>That is our objective, and this Privacy Policy (“Policy”) will explain exactly what we mean in further detail below.</p>

<h2><a id="s2"></a>2.  About this Policy</h2>

<p>This Policy sets out the essential details relating to your personal data relationship with Beats. 
The Policy applies to all Beats services and any associated services (referred to as the "Beats Service"). 
The terms governing your use of the Beats Service are defined in our <a href="file:///C:/Users/class12.DCCHIREC/Desktop/TnC/tc.html" >Terms and Conditions of Use</a> (the “Terms and Conditions of Use”).</p>

<p>From time to time, we may develop new services or offer additional services. If the introduction of these new or additional services results in any change to the way we collect or process your personal data we will provide you with more information and additional terms or policies. Unless stated otherwise when we introduce these new or additional services, they will be subject to this Policy.</p>

<p>The aim of this Policy is to:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Ensure that you understand what personal data we collect about you, the reasons why we collect and use it, and who we share it with;</li>
  <li>Explain the way we use the personal data that you share with us in order to give you a great experience when you are using the Beats Service; and</li>
  <li>Explain your rights and choices in relation to the personal data we collect and process about you and how we will protect your privacy.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>We hope this helps you to understand our privacy commitments to you. For further clarification of the terms used in this Policy please visit our <a href="file:///C:/Users/class12.DCCHIREC/Desktop/TnC/privacycenter.html">Privacy Center</a> on Beats.com. For information on how to contact us if you ever have any questions or concerns, then please see the <a href="#s14">'How to Contact Us’ Section 14</a> below. Alternatively, if you do not agree with the content of this Policy, then please remember it is your choice whether you want to use the Beats Service.</p>

<h2><a id="s3"></a>3. Your rights and your preferences: Giving you choice and control</h2>

<p>You may be aware that a new European Union law, called the General Data Protection Regulation or "GDPR" gives certain rights to individuals in relation to their personal data.  Accordingly, we have implemented additional transparency and access controls in our Privacy Center and Privacy Settings to help users take advantage of those rights.  As available and except as limited under applicable law, the rights afforded to individuals are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Right of Access - the right to be informed of and request access to the personal data we process about you;</li>
<li>Right to Rectification - the right to request that we amend or update your personal data where it is inaccurate or incomplete;</li>
<li>Right to Erasure - the right to request that we delete your personal data;</li>
<li>Right to Restrict - the right to request that we temporarily or permanently stop processing all or some of your personal data;</li>
<li>Right to Object -

<ul>
<li>the right, at any time, to object to us processing your personal data on grounds relating to your particular situation;</li>
<li>the right to object to your personal data being processed for direct marketing purposes;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Right to Data Portability - the right to request a copy of your personal data in electronic format and the right to transmit that personal data for use in another party’s service; and</li>
<li>Right not to be subject to Automated Decision-making - the right to not be subject to a decision based solely on automated decision making, including profiling, where the decision would have a legal effect on you or produce a similarly significant effect.</li>
</ul>

<p><a id="s3.1"></a>In order to enable you to exercise these rights with ease and to record your preferences in relation to how Beats uses your personal data, we provide you with access to the following settings via your Account Settings page:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>Privacy Settings</em></strong> - allows you to control some of the categories of personal data we process about you, 
enables you to access your personal data via a ‘Download my Data’ button, and includes a link to the <a href="file:///C:/Users/class12.DCCHIREC/Desktop/TnC/privacycenter.html">Privacy Center</a> on Beats.com where you can find out more information about how Beats uses your personal data and what your rights are; and,</li>
<li><strong><em>Notification Settings</em></strong> - allows you to choose which communications you receive from Beats, manage your publicly available personal data, and set your sharing preferences.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Privacy Center puts you in control of how Beats processes your personal data. It provides you with information about what happens if you adjust your settings on your Account Settings page and how to opt out of receiving certain messages from Beats. If we send you electronic marketing messages based on your consent or otherwise permitted by applicable law, you may, at any time, withdraw such consent or declare your objection (“opt-out”) at no cost. 
The electronic marketing messages you receive from Beats (e.g. those sent via email) will also include an opt-out mechanism within the message itself 
(e.g. an unsubscribe link in the emails we send to you).</p>

<p>You can find out more about the GDPR rights described above and the controls we provide to all Beats users with respect to these rights in the ‘Your Rights’ section contained in the Privacy Center. If you have any questions about your privacy, your rights, or how to exercise them, please contact our Data Protection Officer using the ‘Contact Us’ form on the Privacy Center. We will respond to your request within a reasonable period of time upon verification of your identity. 
If you are unhappy with the way we are using your personal data you can also contact and are free to lodge a complaint with the Swedish Data Protection Authority 
(Datainspektionen) or your local Data Protection Authority.</p>

<h2><a id="s4"></a>4. How do we collect your personal data?</h2>

<p>We collect your personal data in the following ways:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li><strong><u>When you sign up to the Beats Service</u></strong> - when you sign up to the Beats Service, we collect certain personal data so you can use the Beats Service such as your email address, birth date, gender, and country.</li>
  <li><strong><u>Through your use of the Beats Service</u></strong> - when you use the Beats Service, we collect personal data about your use of the Beats Service, such as what songs you have played and what playlists you have created.</li>
  <li><strong><u>Personal data collected that enables us to provide you with additional features/functionality</u></strong> - from time to time, you may also provide us with additional personal data or give us your permission to collect additional personal data e.g. to provide you with more features or functionality. As described further below (see Voluntary Music Data), we will not collect photos, precise mobile device location, voice data, or contacts from your device without your prior consent. 
You will always have the option to change your mind and withdraw your permission at any time.</li>
  <li><strong><u>From third parties</u></strong> - we will receive personal data about you and your activity from third parties, including advertisers and partners we work with in order to provide you with the Beats Service (please see <a href="#s7">‘Sharing your personal data’ Section 7</a> below). 
We will use this personal data either where you have provided your consent to the third party or to Beats to that data sharing taking place or where Beats has a legitimate interest to use the personal data in order to provide you with the Beats Service.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>We use anonymised and aggregated information for purposes that include testing our IT systems, research, data analysis, creating marketing and promotion models, improving the Beats Service, and developing new features and functionality within the Beats Service.</p>

<h2><a id="s5"></a>5.What personal data do we collect from you?</h2>

<p>We have set out in the tables below the categories of personal data we collect and use about you:</p>

<br>
<br>

(as defined in the <a href="file:///C:/Users/class12.DCCHIREC/Desktop/TnC/tc.html" >Terms and Conditions of Use</a>, such as Facebook) to sign up and use the Beats Service. 
If you use a Third Party Service to create an account, we will receive personal data via that Third Party Service but only when you have consented to that Third Party Service sharing your personal data with us.
